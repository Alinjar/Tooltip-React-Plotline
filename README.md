This is the Take_home Assignment provided to me by Plotline. I have created a Tooltip Builder using React without using any additional libraries. There is also a live preview for the Tooltip Builder. The tooltip builder has two fields to accept Tooltip Text and the Tooltip Position which changes the text and position of the tooltip when hovered over the button. There is also a dropdown menu provided to select the target button eg: Button 1 or Button 2.
The changes will only be applied to the selected Button.
